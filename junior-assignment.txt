Create a web app which allows users to enter and track birthdays of their friends.

Features: 
  - Ability to add new birthdays, using name and birth date
  - If today is someone's birthday, show it on the main page
  - Monthly view, users should be able to see all birthdays for any given month.

Requirements:
  - Use Node.js and Express.js for backend
  - Use in-memory sqlite3 database. Link: https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3
  - After finishing the assignment, send us the url for your github repository.

Not necessary:
  - User management, registration/login etc. Assume that only one person will use this application, on his/her computer, locally.

Not necessary, but bonus points for:
  - Using REST (and JSON) for retrieving data from backend
  - Using any SPA for frontend
  - Using an ORM, like Sequelize
  - Having unit tests
  - Having extra features if you feel like it
  - Good commit messages!

Assignment will be evaluated by:
  - Features working correctly / as intended
  - Code quality. It should be simple and easy to understand
  - Errors handled correctly

Note:
  - You can use any other external library if you want.
